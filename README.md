Looking Glass
============

A cross-browser open-source tool that will identify HTML elements, will suggest and verify xpath, css selectors and more for Selenium Automation Development.


**Video Overview**:

**Compatible**:

OS: Windows, Linux, Mac OS X

Browsers: Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox

*Please note that this is a Selenium based solution.*  
*This means as your browser versions change you need to get latest binaries of Looking Glass.*

**Quick Start**:

1. Install Java 1.7
2. Download zip file from:  https://bitbucket.org/primatestinc/looking-glass/downloads/LookingGlass.zip
3. Unzip contents
4. Double click on LookingGlass.jar file
5. Select browser type you want to work with and click on Open button
6. Navigate to needed URL
7. Click on the looking glass icon and click on element you want to inspect
8. Select "Click" operation from drop down next to "Validate" button
9. Click on the "Click" button to see if Selenium can click on the selected HTML element

**Known Limitations** (I'm currently working on both):

1. Currently does not work on multiple tabs/windows, just the first one that is opened.
2. Currently does not track elements inside iframes.
