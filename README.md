LookingGlass
============

Browser independent HTML Element browser.

Quick Start:

1. Install Java 1.7
2. Download zip file from:  https://bitbucket.org/primatestinc/looking-glass/downloads/LookingGlass.zip
3. Unzip contents and double click on LookingGlass.jar file
4. Select browser type you want to work with and click on Open button
5. Navigate to needed URL
6. Click on the looking glass icon and click on element you want to inspect
7. Select "Click" operation from drop down next to "Validate" button
8. Click on the "Click" button to see if Selenium can click on the selected HTML element

Known Limitations (I'm currently working on both):

1. Currently does not work on multiple windows, just the first one that is opened.
2. Currently does not track elements inside iframes.
